	Our web application will use a minimalistic UI to make navigation quick and simple.
	Many web applications today will clutter the UI with banners and textboxes, which not only 		annoy and overwhelm the user, but also take a toll on performance.<br/>

	We will use a tile design to create large icons for the user to click on and make their 	selection.<br/>
	The currently selected tile will highlight to a different color than the rest while the 	user hovers the mouse over it.<br/>
	The application will also keep a seperate rectangular tile on the top left that displays
	the user's name as well as a profile picture if they have decided to upload one.
	</p></center>

	<center><p><b>Main Menu:</b> The following are concept images for what the user will see 		as soon as they open our web application. We wil present the user with 3 main tiles and 2 		secondary tiles.<br/>
	The three main tiles will house our three main features: <b>Discover</b>, <b>Planner</b> 		and <b>Trending</b>.
